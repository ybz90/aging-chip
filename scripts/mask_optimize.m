          % I have commented out this section of mask optimization in the interest of speed and performance. Since all of the masks are simply being overlaid atop one another anyway, it is a reasonable presumption that there will be little difference if a few masks are missing on certain frames, versus if each frame's mask is used individually, in which case it is crucial that the mother cell is correctly detected and thresholded.



            mask_prop = regionprops(BW3,Icf,'Area','Centroid'); %areas and centroids of the cell masks for the current column

            % Get centroids of all cells and their x,y coordinates
            all_centroids = [mask_prop(:).Centroid];
            x_centroids = all_centroids(1:2:end-1);
            y_centroids = all_centroids(2:2:end);

            % Structure for holding the cell area and centroid data for all cells
            % mask_prop_2 has dimensions of 3 rows (cell properties) x n cols (# of cells in the trap)
            mask_prop_2 = [mask_prop(:).Area; x_centroids; y_centroids];
            %fprintf('Column #%d has %d cells.\n', i, length(mask_prop_2(:))/4); %debug

            % The centroid with the highest y-coordinate value is the cell that is lowest in the trap, aka the mother cell; its index, idx, specifies the column in mask_prop_2 that stores its properties
            [max_y,idx] = max(y_centroids);

            % Properties of the mother cell, from the column #idx
            mother_prop = mask_prop_2(:,idx); %mother_prop(1) is the area of the mother cell
            areas = mask_prop_2(1,:);


            % Mask optimization code for if cells are not detected or if they do not meet certain quality conditions

            %NOTE: Remove all cells below a certain area, to remove the artifacts.
            %NOTE: Add code for declumping cells; since we only care about the lowest mother cell, this will only be needed for cases where a mother and a daughter are still attached when the frame was taken, and so we can approach this using a noncircularity method to identify these scenarios. Then we can do binary watershed or something similar and take the lower most object as the mother.
